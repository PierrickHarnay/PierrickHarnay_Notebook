# *Pocillopora sp.* morphologie detection

## Context of studies 

Our study is based on population genetics of *Pocillopora sp.* on the Polynesian islands based on their often misleading and incorrect morphology. We are therefore trying to understand population dynamics by **Haplotype** so that we can correlate our transect data with our term tolerance data from the laboratory (see NoteBook TPC Haplotype). 

# Protocol
## Stuff 
- Decametre
- Gopro
- Regular cameras
- Whirl pack with labels 
- Hammer 
- Chisel
- Measuring rod with color measumnent 
- Mesh Bag for bring sampling corals
- Cooler (for transport) 
- GPS
- cutting pliers (for the recruit)
- Cooler

## Field protocol

### In the lab
1. Prepare the necessary material for the old field including   
			- Charging the batteries of the camera(s)  
			- Charging the batteries of the Gopro(s)   
			- Labeled bags for sampling   
			- Labeling bags to store samples per transect   
			- Double label the sample storage bags by transect with a sticker   
			- Verify that all materials are ready to leave the next day (a second verification 			  will be done before leaving for the field)   
			
### In the field
1. Select the sampling locations 
2. Check equipment and compare to above list 
3. Load the boat 
4. Once you arrive on site, define who does what and do not change during the trip to avoid missing any step
5. Draw the 50 m transect in the desired direction
6. Using the GPS, take the starting point of the transect as well as the end point
7. Follow the transect by filming the transect with a Gopro (to keep track of the transect in case of doubt during analysis and/or need for more information on the transect)
8. At the beginning of each transect, take a photo of the storage bag so that the photos do not get mixed up during processing.
9. Take a picture of the colony in the global view and of the colony in the closer view by placing the colored ruler close to the colony (see pictures bellow)

![POC_TPC](https://pierrickharnay.github.io/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/images/POC_TPC.JPG) 
10. Take a picture of the bag that will contain the sample  
11. Sample a fragment of a branch of about 4-5cm maximum (depending on the size of the colony)
12. Close the sample bag
13. Place the bag in the meshbag assigned to the transect number
14. Proceed to the next colony 
15. At the end of each transect, take a random photo to separate the transect photos
16. Proceed to the next transect by repeating the steps listed on the protocol.

### When you come back to the field   
1. Put the samples in a freezer at -80Â°C in case the extraction or other analyses are not carried out directly afterwards.
2. Rinse used and unused equipment in the field to avoid breakage or wear due to seawater
3. Repeat the procedure (**In the lab**) for the next day of sampling
4. Download the photos taken by transect and file them on transect files, not forgetting all the photos. Each sample must have 3 photos.
5. Download the GPS data and record the GPS points of the transects in a file

**Important point:**   

**1. All colonies of *Pocillopora sp.* regardless of age or morphology should be collected**  
**2. Each transect must have its own sampling bag to avoid mixing the samples**

## What has already been done  
**Map of the studies zone:**  
The transects will be carried out on 3 sites per side of the island in order to have an overall view of the Mo'orea population. The site in red is the site of transects made in May/June 2022.
