## Sesame 2024. *Pocillopora spp.* Flow / No flow   

### ***Resume of the project.***

In the island of Mo'orea located in French Polynesia, *Pocillopora spp.* are present and conciderate as dominante species around the island (back reef - fore reef) following many event as Crown of Throne, bleaching event (REF). *Pocillopora spp.* show lot of plasticity depending of the depth, light and courant (REF). Identified *Pocillopora spp.* at species level are complicated only by morphology. Molecular work need to be done to detect and identified the species level using mtORF (REF). In this experiment we identify 4 differents species *P.verrucosa* (Haplotype 3), *P. meandrina* (Haplotype 1a - 8a), *P. tuahiniensis* (Haplotype 10)(new specie describe by REF), *P. grandis* (Haplotype 1a) sampled at 2 differents sites conditions; Haapiti **Flow site** (W 149.883782438236 - S 17.5650093638768)and Manava **No flow site** (W 149.807646130636 - S 17.4756927846393). 
Our goal it's to identified the difference and the plasticity the coral make between a site with a hight flow regime compare to a low flow regime condition. For doing that we run the sample at the BeamLine of SESAME in Jordan.   

### Hypothesis   
Depending of the environmental condition, *Pocillopora spp.* will don't have the same skeleton structure interspecific and intraspecific.  

### History of the samples    
#### Colonies from the field

#### µCT images

### Part of the sample run at different resolution   
Each sample was prepare in the field in Mo'orea following [SEM preparation](https://pierrickharnay.github.io/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/Haplotype-charactization-POC_ID_relative-abundace-project/). After being scaned a first time in Germany with µCT, sample was cut one more time to have the correct size for SESAME.   
##### Final cuting:

During expereriment we wanted to focus on the top part of the coral to observe and analysis the growth part. For this **A**) zone wanted to scan at SESAME, **B**) second cut did in germany to have the spot wanted.   

#### Windows used for scanning   
![Resolution_windows.png](https://pierrickharnay.github.io/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/images/Resolution_windows.png)   

*We used to resolution of scan:* Low resolution *(5X - ~36 keV)* and High resolution *(20X - ~20 keV)*. For the sample at **Low resoltuion** we scan 3 windows separe each other per 3mm to never overlap between window. Depending of the shape of the sample, we needed to went bellow 3mm to make sur to have a good scan and the entire piece wish. At **High resolution** only the first window was scan.
