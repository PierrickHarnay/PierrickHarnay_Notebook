## Sesame 2024. *Pocillopora spp.* Flow / No flow   

### ***Resume of the project.***

In the island of Mo'orea located in French Polynesia, *Pocillopora spp.* are present and conciderate as dominante species around the island (back reef - fore reef) following many event as Crown of Throne, bleaching event (REF). *Pocillopora spp.* show lot of plasticity depending of the depth, light and courant (REF). Identified *Pocillopora spp.* at species level are complicated only by morphology. Molecular work need to be done to detect and identified the species level using mtORF (REF). In this experiment we identify 4 differents species *P.verrucosa* (Haplotype 3), *P. meandrina* (Haplotype 1a - 8a), *P. tuahiniensis* (Haplotype 10)(new specie describe by REF), *P. grandis* (Haplotype 1a) sampled at 2 differents sites conditions; Haapiti **Flow site** (W 149.883782438236 - S 17.5650093638768)and Manava **No flow site** (W 149.807646130636 - S 17.4756927846393). 
Our goal it's to identified the difference and the plasticity the coral make between a site with a hight flow regime compare to a low flow regime condition. For doing that we run the sample at the BeamLine of SESAME in Jordan.

### Hypothesis   
Depending of the environmental condition, *Pocillopora spp.* will don't have the same skeleton structure interspecific and intraspecific.
