# Bulk density experiment
### Studies context

This experiment is part of the **POC ID Relative Abundance Characterization project**. The goal of this project is to describe the different species present in the lagoon of Mo'orea at 12 different sites.

The collected samples were prepared following protocol [S.E.M](https://github.com/PierrickHarnay/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-06-12-Haplotype-charactization-POC_ID_relative-abundace-project.md)

. All samples come from the remaining part of the skeleton pieces that were taken for SEM and micro-CT analyses. The samples are not all the same size due to the size variation of the original specimens (small colonies, large colonies).

A total of *1836* samples have been processed. The number of samples per site also varies depending on sample availability.

The protocol used for this experiment comes from [Jose de Jesús A. Tortolero-Langarica et al. 2017](https://peerj.com/articles/3191/#materials%7Cmethods)

#### Equipment:
- Saucepan (2x) / one for heating the water, one for melting the wax (needs to be kept at 105ºC)
- Hot plate (Techwood 1500W)
- Digital thermometer
- High-resolution balance (Mettler Toledo / Excellence Plus XP203S)
- Wax
- Chiller to keep the temperature at 20ºC (DI water)
- Platform to place the samples for weighing in DI water

#### Exemple of Bulk density result on *Pocillopora spp.*.
