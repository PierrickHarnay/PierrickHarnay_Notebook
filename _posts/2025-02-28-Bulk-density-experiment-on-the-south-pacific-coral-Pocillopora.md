# Bulk density experiment
### Studies context

This experiment is part of the **POC ID Relative Abundance Characterization project**. The goal of this project is to describe the different species present in the lagoon of Mo'orea at 12 different sites.

The collected samples were prepared following protocol XXX. All samples come from the remaining part of the skeleton pieces that were taken for SEM and micro-CT analyses. The samples are not all the same size due to the size variation of the original specimens (small colonies, large colonies).

A total of *1836* samples have been processed. The number of samples per site also varies depending on sample availability.

The protocol used for this experiment comes from (CITE).
