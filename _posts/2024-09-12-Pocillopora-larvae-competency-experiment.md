## Resume of project  

Coral spawning is a phenomenon known worldwide, affecting many coral species. However, certain aspects of this reproduction are not well understood, particularly the recruitment phase in species such as *Pocillopora* spp. Many studies have been conducted on *Pocillopora acuta*, but very few have been done on *P. meandrina*, *P. verrucosa*, *P. tuahineensis*, *P. grandis* and *P. cf. effusa*. Crucial for reef development, genetic mixing, habitat creation, and increasing reef complexity, the pre-competency and competency phases must be studied to complete the reproductive cycle of *Pocillopora* spp. In French Polynesia, **Harnay et al. 2024** documented the reproduction of *P. meandrina*, *P. verrucosa*, *P. tuahineensis*, and *P. cf. effusa* for the first time, providing more insights and possibilities for increasing research on the settlement phases.

In this context, this study aims to define a period of pre-competency and competency based on the protocol of **Randal et al. 2024** for *P. meandrina*, *P. verrucosa*, *P. tuahineensis*, *P. cf. effusa* and *P. grandis* in French Polynesia on the island of Mo'orea. 

This step of understanding will help us fill in missing parts of the reproductive cycle and also provide more knowledge about recruitment in cryptic species dominant on many coral reefs worldwide, such as on the island of Mo'orea.

### Protocol    

Dans le cadre de cette experiment nous nous sommes base sur le travail realise par d'autres equipe sur des especes differentes. Notre protocol sera donc en corelation avec Randal et al. 2024.
