## Soleil 2025. *Pocillopora spp.* Flow / No flow   

### ***Resume of the project***

In the island of Mo'orea located in French Polynesia, *Pocillopora spp.* are present and conciderate as dominante species around the island (back reef - fore reef) following many event as Crown of Throne, bleaching event (Gonzalo PÃ©rez-Rosales et al. 2021). *Pocillopora spp.* show lot of plasticity depending of the depth, light and courant (Johnston et al. 2017). Identified *Pocillopora spp.* at species level are complicated only by morphology. Molecular work need to be done to detect and identified the species level using mtORF (Johnston et al. 2022). In this experiment we identify 4 differents species *P.verrucosa* (Haplotype 3), *P. meandrina* (Haplotype 1a - 8a), *P. tuahiniensis* (Haplotype 10)(new specie describe by Johnston and Burgess 2023), *P. grandis* (Haplotype 1a) sampled at 2 differents sites conditions; Haapiti **Flow site** (W 149.883782438236 - S 17.5650093638768)and Manava **No flow site** (W 149.807646130636 - S 17.4756927846393). 
Our goal it's to identified the difference and the plasticity the coral make between a site with a hight flow regime compare to a low flow regime condition. For doing that we run tomography scanning (Scucchia et al. 2023) on our samples at different BeamLine.     

### Idea   
Depending of the environmental condition, *Pocillopora spp.* will don't have the same skeleton structure interspecific and intraspecific. We are also looking at what happen if the differente species of *Pocillopora spp* had different environmental condition on their skeleton. We want to look at the macro and micro feature using Beam, MicroCT, SEM.
