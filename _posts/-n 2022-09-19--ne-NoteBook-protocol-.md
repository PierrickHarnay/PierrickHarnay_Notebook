Making NoteBook post on Github step

# First step:

### Open terminal onws my computer and now we can start the process.

`cd Dropbox/MyProjects/PierrickHarnay_NoteBook` *this step permit to show the direction*


`cd _posts` *this step open the file we want on finder files*

After this both step we need to modified all the file for push all our comment and CV end more
so for doing that used: 

`sh post_template.sh` *and after start all the process*

After then we have 2 more steps to do:
`Categories` for choising on what categrorie we want find our post and `tag` to give us more details for witch categorie


# Second step

**For everystep we have 3 principals commands:**

- `git add` *This comand allows to teh terminal witch file we add some modification and some comment on it* 

`git add -A`  
`git add FILENAME`  
`git add FOLDER`

- `git commit -m "message"` *This comand allows us to put a small comment to discribe all the step we did*
- `git push` *It is the last step for push the modification on the webside*

# Macdown language

###For build a good post nice to look and read we need to used some different writting

When we want put different size of title we need to used `#`:

*for big text* -> `#`| *for medium size* -> `##`| *for smaller size* -> `###`

When we want to do *italic writting*:
`*text*`

When we want **bold writting**:
`**text**`

When we want cross out the text:
`~~text~~`  

When you want implant link to a website:  
`[text](websitelink)`

When you want implant image:   
`![name of image](https://pierrickharnay.github.io/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/images/image.jpeg)`
