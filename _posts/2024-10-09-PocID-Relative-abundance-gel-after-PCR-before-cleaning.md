# Relative abundance *Pocillopora spp.* around the island of Mo'orea

## Context:
Our study is based on population genetics of *Pocillopora sp.* on the Polynesian islands based on their often misleading and incorrect morphology. We are therefore trying to understand population dynamics by **Haplotype** so that we can correlate our transect data with our term tolerance data from the laboratory (see NoteBook TPC Haplotype).

### **PCR** after extracion and nano drop control:   
#### Protocol: 


### **Gel process control of DNA quality**
#### Protocol:

During the process we used differentes size of gel. For this raison we have list bellow all the different way to make the gel at **1.5%**. 

##### Small size of gel: 
-  1.12g of **Agarose** 
-  75ml of **1x TAE Buffer**
-  1µl of **gelgreen**. 

##### Medium size of gel:
-  1.50g of **Agarose** 
-  100ml of **1x TAE Buffer**
-  1µl of **gelgreen**. 

##### Large size of gel:
-  2.25 of **Agarose** 
-  150ml of **1x TAE Buffer**
-  1µl of **gelgreen**. 

On each gel add 4µl of **lader** on one side of the gel. On each gel add 4µl of samples in each well. Run the gel at 100V during 35 minutes.
