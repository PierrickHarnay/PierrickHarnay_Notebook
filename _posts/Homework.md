## Homework
### *Create your Notebook post and plubish it:*

Following on from what we've seen together on the introduction and application of GitHub and Markdown to science.
We ask you to write a protocol (subject of your choice) following the requested framework. The protocol must be written in a text editor of your choice between **Markdown**, **Atom** or **Visual Studio**.

#### _Within this protocol you will need to have the following points:_ 

- Organize titles in different sizes
- Use **bold**, *italic* and _underline_ in the protocol 
- Insert photos with captions  
For exemple:   
   
![poc_faucon_exemple_pic.png](https://pierrickharnay.github.io/PierrickHarnay_Notebook/images/poc_faucon_exemple_pic.png)   

- Insert tables (screenshots not allowed)     
For exemple:   

| Date | Site | Coral cover | Algae cover | CCA cover | ... |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----|
|      |      |             |             |           |     |
|      |      |             |             |           |     |
|      |      |             |             |           |     |
|      |      |             |             |           |     |
|      |      |             |             |           |     |


- insert links to scientific references   
For exemple: [Coral bleaching: the role of the host](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534708003236)   

You are free to choose the length of the protocol, but all the points requested must be present. 

When the protocol is finished, please add it to your github Notebook and send us the link to it on the Platform.
