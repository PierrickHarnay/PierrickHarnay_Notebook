##Daily accomplishment
### 18 september 2023:
Unpacking suplies and starting to setup the PI Curve TPC station. Thinking about the plan and what do we need to do day per day to finish the filed trip in time.

###19 september 2023: 
- Field: 
We want in the field at the reef 30 (HIMB localisation) for collecting corals to run all the PI Curve TPC. We went in the filed between 8:30 and 9:45am and collected colonies of *Montipora capitata*, *Porites compressa* and *Pocillopora acuta*. We collected 8 genotype for each species around the same area. 
Unfortunetly with confusion we miss one colonie of *P.acuta*. 

- Wet Lab / Coral table:  
We taged 10 plug for each colonie with the letter **A**,**B**,**C**,**D**,**E**,**F**,**G** and **H**. Futher we fragment and glue each colonies on the plug create for (following the Genotype letter and number (1 to 
10)) between 5:00 and 5:30pm.

Wet Lab / Daily mesurment: 
Load the Hobo loger : Incubator 2 start at 12:10  - Control tank 2 start at 12:10 
Put in the water at 12:09

####15:45####
Daily mesurment and add salinity, pH. The light mesurment was disturb because of the sky (cloudy). 

####16:30 to 17:45####
Start to plug extras fragments for different colony. Not all teh colony have fragment in addition.   
***P. compressa*** add F11, F12, F13,F14 / G11, G12, G13, G14 and E11, E12, E13, E14, E15, E16.  

***M. capitata*** add A11, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A18, A19, A20, A21 / D11, D12, D13 and F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16. 
  
***P. acuta*** add G11, G12, G13, G14 / C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20 / B11, B12, B13, B14 and A11, A12, A13, A14.
