#Haplotype characterization | POC_ID
## Summary 
As part of my PhD project on *Settlement and post settlement challenges to successful recruitment for reef building corals* the second chapter focused on the relative abundance of Pocillopora sp. within the Moorea lagoon. A characterization study of the calcareous skeleton by Haplotype (Johnston et al 2021) will be carried out. In addition to genetic identification, this study will enable us to understand the plasticity of each Haplotype as a function of its natural environment. It will also highlight the great interspecific diversity of Pocillopora sp. populations. Analysis of the fragments will be carried out at Haifa University using the SEM 3D Imagine technique (Goodbody-Gringley & Waletich, 2018; Doherty, Matthew et al. 2023)

## Protocol
### Data

The samples used in this process come from the relative abundance project transects (POC-ID). The complete data are located on a table constituting the tracking of each of them. This can be found at the following link. For each modification or fragmentation, the columns **Imagine-Sample**, **Bag-number**, **Storage**, **Imagine-sample-backup**, **Bag-number-backup**, **Storage_backup** must be completed and updated as frequently as possible. Each fragment is stored in Whirlpak bags and stored in freezers at -40Â°C within a meshbag numbered by **Site**, **Transect** and **Date**. For each sample (Whirlpak), **number sample**, project ID **POC-ID** and name of the leader of project **PH** are recorded. 

### Fragmentation 
The aim of the manipulation is to have a fragment with a size of about **1cmX1cm** in order to have a sufficiently large analysis surface to facilitate MES imaging at Haifa University. A backup fragment will also be created to keep a fragment at the GUMP Field Station in case of any problems.
Corals will be cut using the *Gryphon diamond band saw* (cutting protocol can be found on the following link): link 

### Materials
- Coral saw (*Gryphon diamond band saw*)
- Plastic cup
- Zip block bag size 2 "X3" (*2ml*)
- Sticker for **sample number**, **date**, **site**, **transect** X2. Write **backup** on second zipblock bag
- Paper to write **sample number**, **date**, **site**, **transect** X2. Write **backup** on second zipblock bag
- Sharpie pencil 
- Bleach
- Gloves 
- Fresh water
- Paper towel
- Drying plate to dry bleach fragments before putting them in zipblock bag

### Sample preparation for shipping 
Before cutting the fragments, perform the following steps:  
1. Number the plastic cup with **sample number**, **site**, **transect**.  
2. Number the Sticker (2x) and Paper (2X) with **sample number**, **date**, **site**, **transect**. For the second sticker and paper, enter **backup**.  
3. Dilute bleach to **10%**.   
3. Cut fragments **(sample, sample backup)** following fragmentation steps with *Gryphon diamond band saw*.  
4. Fill plastic cup with bleach diluted to **10%** to cover fragments **(sample, sample backup)** (*10ml* should be sufficient)   
5. Wait **12h** processing time with bleach to ensure that no coral tissue remains on the fragment.   
6. Rinse fragments with fresh water to remove remaining bleach  
7. Dry the fragments (sample, sample backup) on a paper towel, placing the paper ( **sample number**, **date**, **site**, **transect**) intended for the zipblock bag next to the fragments to track the samples during the drying period. Perform the drying period over a period of **24h**.   
8. Stick the stickers from **step 2** onto the zipblock bag.  
9. Place the papers and fragments in the zipblock bag concerned.  
10. Put the zipblock bag of the fragment destined for Haifa University into the box, respecting the **site/transect** organization, then do the same for the sample backup remaining at GUMP Field Sation.     
11. Compile excel spreadsheet on GitHub to track samples  

### Storage 
Corals leaving for Haifa University will be stored by **Site/Transect** and then stored in a box containing all samples. 
Corals remaining in Moorea will be stored by **Site/Transect** and then stored in a box containing all samples.
